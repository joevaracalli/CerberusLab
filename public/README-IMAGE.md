# Add Nova Music Artist Photo

To add the Nova Music artist photo:

1. Save the black and white photo you sent as `nova-music-artist.png`
2. Place it in the `public/` folder
3. The website will automatically display it in the artist card

The image should be:
- Named: `nova-music-artist.png`
- Location: `public/nova-music-artist.png`
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Recommended size: 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio works best)

If the image doesn't load, it will fallback to showing the "N" initial with a red gradient background.
